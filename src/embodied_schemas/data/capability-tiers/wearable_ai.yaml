description: >
  Ultra-low power wearable devices with severe thermal and battery constraints.
  Requires aggressive model optimization (quantization, pruning) and often
  relies on sensor fusion with minimal on-device inference.

typical_applications:
  - Smartwatches with health monitoring
  - AR/VR glasses with eye tracking
  - Hearing aids with noise cancellation
  - Fitness trackers with activity recognition
  - Smart rings with gesture detection
