# Drone Inspection Use Case
# Visual inspection of infrastructure, buildings, and industrial assets

id: drone_inspection
name: Drone Visual Inspection
category: drone
description: |
  Automated visual inspection of infrastructure using high-resolution imaging
  and AI-based defect detection. Used for power lines, bridges, wind turbines,
  solar panels, and building facades. Prioritizes accuracy over speed.
