id: drone_obstacle_avoidance
name: Drone Obstacle Avoidance
category: drone
description: |
  Real-time detection and avoidance of obstacles during autonomous flight.
  Requires low-latency perception for safe navigation in cluttered environments.
  Must operate on battery power with strict weight and power constraints.
